              Booking a consultation through this site (for example, via Calendly)
              does not create any obligation for either party to enter into a

              written agreement or proposal.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              We reserve the right to decline or terminate engagements at our

            <p class="card-body">
              We respect the confidentiality of information you share during
              consulting engagements and will take reasonable steps to protect it.
              However, we may reference anonymized learnings or patterns in our
              marketing or educational content, without identifying you or your
              organization.

              To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any
              indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
              any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or
              indirectly, arising from your use of this website or our services.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              Our total liability for any claims arising out of or relating to the
              services will be limited to the amount you have paid us for those
